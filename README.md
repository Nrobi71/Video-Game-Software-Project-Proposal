# The American Video Game Company: Software Project Proposal

## INTRODUCTION:

In this assessment, you will review a requirements document and then propose a software solution. Your submission will showcase what you’ve learned in the course through the creation of a design and test plan, which is a deliverable for the waterfall methodology. Review the scenario, requirements, and rubric below for additional guidance as you complete this assessment.



## SCENARIO:

You are a member of a software development team for a project, which includes business analysts, solution analysts, developers, quality assurance professionals, and a project manager, among other team members. You have been tasked with completing a solution proposal and design and test plan with the help of your team to support the software development process. The American Video Game Company has provided a high-level requirements document to aid you in identifying an appropriate solution.



The project is to implement a customer relationship management (CRM) system for the sales force of a medium-sized company. The initial requirements document has been provided for you to use in determining a solution. You may choose to implement a customizable/commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) system, or you may decide to have the system custom built. When making this decision, ensure all requirements are considered and can be implemented if choosing a COTS system. If you decide to build the system, consider the additional resources that will be needed. Review the attached “CRM Requirements” document provided with the assessment to gain an overall understanding of the system the American Video Game Company is looking for.


## REQUIREMENTS:

Review the attached “CRM Requirements” to gain an overall understanding of the system that American Video Game Company is looking for. Then propose a software solution for American Video Game Company by doing the following:

 

A.  Introduce your proposed system, including a purpose statement, overview of the problem, goals and objectives for the project and solution, prerequisites, scope, and environment, as outlined in the attached “Design Template.” 



Note: The Introduction section of this report may be done after the project task is completed.



B.  Explain how your software solution addresses five distinct requirements from the attached “CRM Requirements.” 



C.  Discuss the waterfall method by doing the following:

1.  Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the waterfall method to those of another development method of your choice.

2.  Evaluate whether the waterfall method or the development method you chose in C1 is better suited to the solution for American Video Game Company, including specific examples to justify your claims.



D.  Create two visual representations of your software solution (e.g., storyboard, flowchart, UML diagram, ERD) that illustrate how the system process or workflow aligns with and supports the business process for American Video Game Company. 



E.  Create a test plan with test cases for three different functional aspects of your software solution, including the following:

•   preconditions for each  test case

•   steps for each  test case

•   expected results for each  test case 



F.  Acknowledge sources, using in-text citations and references, for content that is quoted, paraphrased, or summarized.
